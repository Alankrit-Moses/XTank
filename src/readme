This folder contains the src java files. We have used the Composite Pattern for the tank and Walls which inherits from the Elements class. The Server and Client are 
based on the MVC architecture. 

Due to slow internet issues, there might be a problem trying to connect to the server from other computers. It can also lead to a delay in sending/receiving data between
server and client which causes asynchronous behaviour leading to errors and crashes. We would suggest you to please test it on a single machine. 
Just run the main file and follow the oncscreen prompts. We are not handling invalid input so please be careful :)))
Thankyou!
